# Project Description:

#### Problem
We may observe that areas with heavy traffic only have these issues in such locations, such as major thoroughfares. This is so because highways connect a lot of different side roads. In general, these subroutes that are connected to the main highway do not experience traffic issues, but when traffic on these subroutes increases on the main highway, it causes traffic problems there.

#### Solution
At the moment, if there is a traffic issue, the specific traffic light system fails to resolve the issue at some point. this is due to the fact that at the moment, traffic signals do not change based on the density of vehicles using that traffic signal. While synchronizing one traffic signal, we will also synchronize all the other traffic signals in the area, say all the traffic signals in Dhaka.

#### Technology Used
To put it simply, we have developed this model utilizing a GUI and certain built-in libraries. Python was selected as the language since it supports OOP and has built-in libraries for GUI.
